    content: In the heart of the island lies a rainforest garden bursting with colour and life. The Papillote Tropical Gardens, in the shadow of Trafalgar Falls, offer a natural sanctuary to immerse yourself in; brimming with effortless beauty and rare wildlife encounters. Wander the trails and discover all manner of exotic plant life, before retreating to a selection of local restaurants for ital or creole fare in this outdoor wonderland.

    title: Trafalgar Falls
    content: Set within the beautiful and peaceful Papillote Wilderness Retreat, these beguiling falls are a famed island beauty spot. There’s two to draw your eye, one called Mother, the other Father. They cascade from a vast mountain outcrop, in a spellbinding sight that draws visitors time and time again. For a truly indulgent experience, don’t miss the natural thermal pools dotted around for a chance to unwind; or, simply book in for a massage at the local retreat.

    title: Wotten Waven
    content: This tiny village sits on a vast playground of thermal pools and cool streams. Locals have rather ingeniously set up shop, staking out their own little pools for you to dip and relax into. The hot sulphur spring water, unappetizingly murky, is purported to have medicinal qualities; but the main takeaway should be that sitting in the warm waters under a jungle canopy is nothing short of exquisite. Each mini spa stays open after sunset, so for a special end to your day, head here for then with a drink in hand.

  - id: victoria-falls
    title: Victoria Falls
    content: Victoria Falls is possibly the island’s most spectacular waterfall, with vast, misty plumes steaming upward from the pool of water at its base. Falling from a dizzying height, the water is fed by the Boiling Lake. Reaching the falls – with a guide – will see you traversing jungle paths, getting back to nature for the glorious reveal at the end. The highlight from here on is the selection of gorgeous restaurants serving Caribbean faves. Come here for the view, stay to indulge in the food.

    title: Soufriere Sulphur Springs
    content: These volcanic springs are a true volcanic oddity, but an oddity that provides endless relaxation. A series of pools dot the area, emitting that rather unique smell (you’ll get used to it!) that should, by rights, be wholly inviting. The water is wonderfully warm, often cascading like a shower from a natural rock lip. One thing to note is some of the larger public pools were destroyed by Hurricane Maria, but for all her efforts, they're being rebuilt – with slightly further away pools still open.

  - id: botanic-gardens
    title: Botanic Gardens
    content: This wonderfully pleasant corner of Roseau makes for idyllic walks amongst rare and colourful flora and fauna. A Dominican institution, the gardens have always been important for conservation work across the nature island. Don’t miss the crushed school bus still stuck under the weight of a fallen baobab tree following the 1979 hurricane, nor the aviary which plays home to rare and colourful parrots.
